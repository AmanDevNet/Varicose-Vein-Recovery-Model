Varicose Vein Recovery ML Model
This project implements a machine learning model to simulate and demonstrate the potential health benefits of a multivitamin syrup, specifically formulated with beetroot and fenugreek, in the treatment and recovery of varicose veins. This model uses synthetic data to illustrate the hypothesized efficacy of these natural ingredients.

Project Goal
The primary objective of this project is to provide a computational simulation that illustrates how a combined multivitamin syrup of beetroot and fenugreek can lead to desired improvements in varicose vein symptoms and recovery time. The output is designed to be clear and informative, showcasing the model's capabilities.

Features
Terminal-Based Input: Users can provide patient-specific data directly through the command line.

Dual Machine Learning Models:

RandomForestClassifier: Classifies the patient's varicose vein risk level (Low, Moderate, High).

GradientBoostingRegressor: Estimates the recovery time in weeks.

Synthetic Data Generation: Creates a realistic dataset (5000-10000 samples) for model training and validation.

Chart Generation:

Generates a output_chart.png visualizing the decrease in pain and swelling, and an increase in activity level over the estimated recovery period, on a dark background.

Generates an intake_impact.png showing the correlation between supplement intake and recovery metrics.

Comprehensive Output: Provides detailed predictions, including risk level, estimated recovery time, and a crucial "Supplement Comparison" section that highlights the impact of beetroot and fenugreek intake versus no supplements or optimal intake.

Results Summary: Saves a results_summary.txt file containing all prediction details and a narrative summary.

Model Persistence: Saves the trained models (.pkl files) for future use without retraining.

How It Works
The project simulates the progression and recovery of varicose veins based on various input factors.

Data Generation: A synthetic dataset is created, mimicking realistic patient profiles and recovery patterns, where beetroot and fenugreek intake are designed to positively influence outcomes.

Model Training:

The RandomForestClassifier learns to categorize risk levels (Low, Moderate, High) based on the input features.

The GradientBoostingRegressor learns to predict the recovery time in weeks.

User Input: You provide specific patient parameters (age, BMI, symptoms, supplement intake) via the terminal.

Prediction: The trained models use your input to predict the risk level and estimated recovery time for the simulated patient.

Supplement Comparison: A key feature where the model compares the predicted outcome for your input against a scenario with "No supplements" and an "Optimal supplements" scenario, directly demonstrating the benefits.

Visualization & Summary:  Charts are generated to visually represent the recovery progression, and a summary text file captures all the results.
